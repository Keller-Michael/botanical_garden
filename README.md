# Botanical Garden
Sun, water and a lot of care are in my opinion a good start for a "botanical Geek garden". In this virtual garden on GitHub there are some ABAP source codes, memories, design sources and more that I discovered on the internet and that I find useful and interesting. Updates as it fits.
